You need to grab the FTEQW engine binaries yourself to play the game. http://fte.triptohell.info/
With the executable in the same root directory as the `game` directory, running it with `-game game` should be enough.

- Spike for the FTEQW engine.
- pitchatan for music and sound.
- Shpuld for the rest.
